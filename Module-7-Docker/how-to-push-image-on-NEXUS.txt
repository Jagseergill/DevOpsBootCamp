First of all we have to install the NExus server. 

1. First, let's create a repo on NEXUS server type we can select hosted. 

2. Then,let create a role for Docker repo.

3. Once the roles are created then we can assign to user.


4. In Realm tab on the nexus server, we have to add token for docker to push the images on NEXUS repo. 

5. We havea repo which created on NEXUS however, this time we have to open additonal port any like 8083 / also add this port on firwall to allow trafic on this specific port. 

6. This the steps which we have to follow on nexus servers. Nowe lets bakc to local docker server. 

7. Bydeafult docker can't push images on http traffic, so we have to add file under /etc/docket/deamon.json

7. ADD this lines in the file 
{
  "insecure-registries" : ["ip-addr:8083"]
}

8. Once this added then we have to restart the docker deamon. 

9. then we can login on our system by using --> docker login ip-add:port-number 

10. Enter the credential which we have on NEXUS server. 

11.some sueful cmd are below

sudo docker build -t my-image:1.0 .

sudo docker tag my-image:1.0 165.22.229.234:8083/my-image:1.0

sudo docker push 165.22.229.234:8083/my-image:1.0
