WE have to add the below information into build.gradle file just below the 
sourceCompatibility = 1.8

##################
apply plugin: 'maven-publish'
publishing {
    publications {
        maven(MavenPublication){
            artifact("build/libs/my-app-$version"+".jar"){
                extension 'jar'
            }
        }
    }

    repositories {
        maven {
            name 'nexus'
            url "Nexus repo URL"
            allowInsecureProtocol = true
            credentials{
                username project.repoUser
                password project.repoPassword
            }
        }
    }
}

also we have to cretae a gradle.properties fiel to store our user information. 
after that we can can build by using gradlew build --> then ---> gradlew publish --- to on Nexus repo manager
