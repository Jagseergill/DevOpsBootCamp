Demo Project:
Create server and deploy the application on DigitalOcean

Technologies used:
DigitalOcean, Linux, Java, Gradle

Project Description:
Setup and configure a server on DigitalOcean

Create and configure a new Linux user on the Droplet

(Security best practice)

Deploy and run a Java Gradle application on Droplet

First, we have to create a server on Digital Ocean.

DigitalOcean - The developer cloud
Businesses grow faster when developers can build on the simple, affordable cloud they love. DigitalOcean has the cloud…

once the server is created then Clone the java project into an IDE tool like IntelliJ.

Build the project by using gradle.

gradlew build

once the project is built we can see the jar file under the build/lib folder.


first, we have to copy this jar file into the server. Then we can start the application by using the below command:-

java -jar java-react-example.jar

You can see the application started on port number 7071.

Here, we can access our application by IP then followed by port number.


This is just the flow of how we can build a java application using gradle.
